## Technical task - Coordinate System

### Write a console application based on the following requirements:
####  1.	The program reads it's input from a text file on the file system
####  2.	Each line of the input file contains definitions for a point in a 2d coordinate system
####  a.	Format of a single point is: PointNo(coord_axis_x, coord_axis_y)
####  b.	Point1(2, 3)
####  c.	Point2(-3,-9)
####  d.	Point3(-5, 2)
####  e.	...
####  3.	Output
####  a.	which point(s) are the furthest from the center (0, 0) in a straight line
####  b.	in which quadrant those points are
####  c.	the result can be printed in the console or in output file
####  Considerations:
####  •	The application should run on another machine without extra configuration/setup
####  •	Consider the most suitable types for your variables
####  •	Consider suitable input validations
####  •	Consider corner cases
